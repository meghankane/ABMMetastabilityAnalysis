Computes the augmented rate matrix from several rate matrices and a succession
of time steps. The slices of `rates_tensor` are rate matrices that describe the
rates of transition between the states of a Discretized Markov process at times
for `t` in `time_steps`.

- `M`: is the number of disjoint intervals of time.
- `N`: is the number of states of the Discretized Markov process.
